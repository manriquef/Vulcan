*Vulcan version* with EmbedAPI.com alternative for Embedly package, used internally. 

Works fine you just need to sign up at EmbedAPI.com and request an api key

Then add it to your settings.json file embedAPIKey:"YOU API KEY"

That's and enjoy your day :)

More version for older Telescope version will be added in other branches....
